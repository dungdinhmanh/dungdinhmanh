# Hello, I'm dungdinhmanh üëã

Welcome to my corner of the internet! Let me tell you a bit about myself through this casual interview-style introduction.

---

## **Q: Who are you and what do you do?**

**A:** I'm a tech enthusiast from Vietnam who's passionate about learning through hands-on projects. While I wouldn't call myself a seasoned developer yet, I love diving into different technologies - from Python and web development to Linux system administration. I learn by building things that interest me, often with help from the amazing developer community and modern tools.

## **Q: What's your current main project?**

**A:** I'm currently developing **[KivotOS](https://github.com/dungdinhmanh/KivotOS)** - a Linux distribution that brings the world of Blue Archive to your desktop experience. It's essentially "Linux meets Blue Archive" with Arona as your system assistant!

::: tip What is KivotOS?
KivotOS is more than just a themed Linux distro - it's about making the computing experience more engaging and fun while maintaining all the power and flexibility that Linux users love.

## **Q: How did you get into programming?**

**A:** I started out of curiosity about how things work under the hood. I'm still on my learning journey - picking up bits of Python, web technologies, C++, and system administration as I go. I believe in learning by doing, even if it means making mistakes and relying on documentation, communities, and yes, AI assistance along the way.

## **Q: What technologies do you work with?**

**A:** My toolkit includes:

```bash
# What I'm Learning
- Linux system administration & package management
- Shell scripting & automation
- Python basics for various tasks

# Web Technologies  
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
- Vue.js & VitePress (like this blog!)
- Static site generation

# Tools & Platforms
- Git & GitHub workflows
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Various Linux distributions
```

## **Q: What inspires your work?**

**A:** I believe in making technology more fun with anime aesthetics! There's something magical about combining the efficiency of open-source software with the charm and personality of anime culture.

"Why should software be boring when it can be both powerful AND delightful?"
